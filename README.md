## What It Does

A browser-based dispatch planning tool that generates fair, efficient daily routes for a 14-driver triaxle fleet across three North Alabama quarry locations. Built to solve real problems in a real dispatch operation — zone rotation, backhaul logic, scrap runs, Bridgeport scheduling, and driver fairness tracking.

**Core operations it handles:**
- Zone rotation across Cherokee, Mt. Hope, and Bridgeport quarries
- Fair driver assignment that tracks workload and prevents burnout
- Scrap run and POD (Proof of Delivery) scheduling
- Preload and backhaul logic
- Daily dispatch schedule generation

## The Fleet

14 active triaxle drivers:
`Marcus · Brittany · Eboni · Deletra · Stacey · Alexis · Kenny · Charlie · Jamie · Bryant · Jonathon · Jimmy · Eddie · Roberto`

## Constitutional Alignment

This tool is built for the real world — a dispatcher who is also the sole provider for his family. Every design decision follows the [ShaneTheBrain Constitution](https://github.com/thebardchat/constitution/blob/main/CONSTITUTION.md):

- **ADHD-aware design** — one screen, clear actions, no friction
- **Local-first** — runs fully offline on Pi, no cloud required
- **Serves the left-behind** — built for operators, not SaaS buyers
